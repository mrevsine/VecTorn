# Results for training an HMM using the chr22_23M_24M.fa file as a human reference and the univec.fa file as a vector reference, then testing on kmers from those same files
# Basically a check to see if this method is high-powered enough to detect a difference between human and vector
# k is the size of tokens used in the HMM
# overlapping refers to whether the tokenization was overlapping or not, e.g. for the seq "AAACTT", overlapping = True yields ["AAA","AAC","ACT","CTT"] while overlapping = False yields ["AAA","CTT"]
# These are not real results since you can't test on your training set, but they may be somewhat interesting
